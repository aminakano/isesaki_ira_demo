# React Dashboard

This is a dashboard application using React. The purpose of this app is to display and manage your holdings of cryptocurrencies and visualise with charts and tables. I chose CoinGecko API for an endpoint of this app since it is easy to use, free and API key is not required.

#### CoinGecko API

<https://www.coingecko.com/en/api>

## How to use

- `git clone` or download the project
- `npm install` at the client directory
- Create a JavaScript file called `myData.js` under `src/api` directory which contains an array of your cryptocurrency holding data

### Alternatively, you could also use `myDataArray.js` which contains sample data by changing its file name to `myData.js`

#### Example data

```
export const myHoldings = [{
  id: "bitcoin",
  name: "btc",
  amount: 11111,
}]
```

And `id` should correspond to coin id and `name` a symbol of a currency. IDs and symbols can be found by querying <https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list>

- `npm start`
